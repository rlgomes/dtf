 Sometimes there are setups where communication over the normal DTF ports will 
 not be possible  because there are firewalls between two points you're trying
 to connect the various components of DTF. These situations are common and 
 because of that DTF can tunnel all communication over any other local port 
 to talk to the machine in question as long as you setup the tunneling ports 
 correctly. Now lets first look at the scenario where we use the tunneling 
 feature to tunnel over ssh to a machine that only has ssh open and wouldn't 
 allow you to start up an agent and connect to it on whatever random port it 
 usually gets assigned. So we have machine A that resides on a network where 
 the only way to get to that machine is over ssh and we have machine B where 
 we're going to run our DTFC and DTFX. Now we push out the build as we would 
 normally do and then on machine B we'd use the tool ssh_tunnel.sh found in 
 the distribution base directory. This tool is pretty straightforward and 
 requires some Unix commands in order to work at the moment. So here are the 
 things we need to decide at this point:
 <ol>
  <li> Whats the port we're going to use on both the DTFA side for listening 
       and the DTFC side for forwarding. We'll keep it to the same port for 
       simplicity of making sense of the setup, but we need to figure out the 
       port before we start anything.
  </li>
  <li> Add a tunnel on the DTFC side using the ssh_tunnel.sh like so 
       (remember to always qualify the hostname completely hostname + domain):
       <pre>./ssh_tunnel.sh add B.domain 30000</pre>
  </li>
  <li> Once the above is done you'll have 1 reverse tunnel from machine B to 
       machine A on port 2000 that would connect the DTFA to the DTFC and 
       you'll also have a local ssh tunnel on port 30000 to port 30000 of the i
       machine B over the ssh tunnel. So now you can start your DTFA on 
       machine B like so: 
       <pre>./ant.sh run_dtfa -Ddtf.tunneled=true -Ddtf.listen.port=30000 <pre>
       (remember to match the port with the right port you assigned during the
       creation of the tunnel on the DTFC as well as to have the dtf.tunneled 
       flag set to true otherwise the Agent will not connect tot he DTFC)
  </li>
  <li> You can list the tunnel at anytime by using the: 
       <pre>./ssh_tunnel.sh list</pre>
  </li>
  <li> Removing the tunnel is as easy as doing: 
       <pre>./ssh_tunnel.sh del B.domain </pre>
       (Again remember to fully qualify the name of the host with the domain 
       name in order for this to work correctly), by removing the tunnel.conf 
       file you'll remove all the tunnels. Whenever an entry from this file 
       disappears the actual ssh tunnels that are running in the background 
       will automatically die off on their own within a few seconds.
  </li>
  <li> Now you can run your DTFX any machine you'd like because in this 
       scenario we always tunnel all requests through the DTFC. So as long as 
       your DTFX and DTFC can communicate then you're tests will execute 
       normally.
  </li>
  <li> Other tunneling methods can be used and you can also edit the 
       tunnel.conf file to redirect traffic through a TCPReflector like tool 
       and be able to debug the data being sent.
  </li>
