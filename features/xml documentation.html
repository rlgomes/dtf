 When writing tests you can document those tests using JavaDoc tags, that are 
 then transformed into this document you are reading right now. Using these 
 tags is a really simple and you only need to know some HTML if you want to 
 make your documentation look a bit neater. Here are the list of available 
 documentation tags that you can use within your tags and also to document any
 new features built into DTF.
 </p>
 <p>
 For examples on using these tags just have a look at any source file with 
 '@dtf.feature' or '@dtf.tag' taglets in them and you'll find various examples 
 on how to use this feature to better the documentation of your code.

  <h2>Feature Documentation</h2>
  <p>
  The feature documentation allows the developer to document features that may 
  not be a simple XML tag and instead could be the documentation of how 
  certain dynamic properties work or the documentation on how ranges work.
  </p>
  <p>
  The only two things you need to define for a feature is what the name of
  the feature is and which feature group it belongs to. The name of the feature
  will appear as a link underneat the feature group. There are some already 
  existing groups that you can attach your documentation to or you can build
  your own group name and that will be added to the list of documented 
  features in the generated feature documentation.

          <td>
          The logical group belongs to within the documentation being 
          generated. This is going to be used to display this feature within
          the same group as as other features with the same group name.

          might be useful for the test writers that may find this feature to 
          be useful. You can place almost any HTML elements in this section
