 The deployment feature is used by identifying a deployment configuration file
 as explained in the <a href='../features/command line usage.html'>Command Line Usage</a> section. This 
 configuration file is written in XML and is quite simple to use. Here is a 
 basic configuration file to start understanding how to write your own 
 configuration file:
 <p>
 
 <pre>&lt;setup xmlns="http://dtf.org/v1"&gt;
      &lt;dtfc host="${host}" path="dtf/dtfc" user="${user}"&gt;
          &lt;dtfa host="${host}" path="dtf/dtfa1" user="${user}"&gt;
              &lt;property name="node.id" value="1"/&gt;
          &lt;/dtfa&gt;
          &lt;dtfa host="${host}" path="dtf/dtfa2" user="${user}"&gt;
              &lt;property name="node.id" value="2"/&gt;
          &lt;/dtfa&gt;
          &lt;dtfa host="${host}" path="dtf/dtfa3" user="${user}"&gt;
              &lt;property name="node.id" value="3"/&gt;
          &lt;/dtfa&gt;
          &lt;dtfx host="${host}" logs="tests/ut/output/ut_results.xml" path="dtf/dtfx" test="tests/ut/echo.xml" user="${user}"&gt;
          &lt;/dtfx&gt;
      &lt;/dtfc&gt;
  &lt;/setup&gt;
</pre>
  
  <p>
  Now from the previous example you can see that the configuration file is 
  very easy to read and you could easily get started writing your own quickly.
  Just as any other DTF XML file you can use properties that you can easily 
  then specify on the command line and control the deployment setup easily 
  from the command line.
  </p>
  <p>
  Aside from being able to use the properties you can also specify the exact 
  properties to load into each component at startup. The property loading is 
  done the same way as it would be when you're using the <b>dtf.defaults</b>
  property but the loading is handled by the deployment feature itself. You 
  can read more on the <b>dtf.defaults</b> feature at 
  <a href='../features/loading default properties.html'>Loading Default Properties</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  There are a few other important attributes to be specified when identifying
  the various components that make up your DTF setup. These attributes are all
  well documented at <a href='../features/deployment tags.html'>Deployment Tags</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  Another few things to remember when writing these configuration files is 
  that you don't have to identify the DTFX and can instead use this file to 
  simply startup and run your tests against the same setup many times. You 
  can also use the deploy-status to check the status of the setup and easily
  restart the deployment before running your existing tests against a well 
  known and well defined setup.
