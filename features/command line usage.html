 Deploying DTF to several machines and setting it up to run can be done 
 manually and isn't that hard all you have to do is copy the build/dtf/dist 
 directory to the machine you want to start any of the DTF components and 
 then you can issue the appropriate command line to start that component up. 
 You will need a Sun JDK 1.5+ to execute the components and then you can start
 them up with the following example command lines:
 <p>
 
 Start up the DTFC (Controller):
 <pre>./ant.sh run_dtfc</pre>
 
 Start up a DTFA and connect it to the controller on the specified address:
 <pre>./ant.sh run_dtfa -Ddtf.connect.addr=host_machine_for_dtfc</pre>
 
 Start up the test tests/xxx.xml and run it against the controller on the 
 specified address:
 <pre>./ant.sh run_dtfx -Ddtf.connect.addr=host_machine_for_dtfc -Ddtf.xml.filename=tests/ut/echo.xml</pre>
 
 <p>
 That is the manual way and is easy enough for small setups with just 2-3 
 agents but when we get into larger setups that run multiple client side 
 agents and a few other server side agents and we have to use SSH tunneling 
 in order to connect some of those agents back to the controller machine we 
 find that the setup time is long and prone to errors. In order to make this 
 easier, there is a way of starting up your DTF setup by just passing a 
 configuration file to a few targets in your build and requesting to check 
 the status, stop and start your setup, etc. This takes care of all of the 
 configuration steps for you. Lets start by showing what the format of the 
 actual configuration file looks like:

 <p>
 Many of you will notice that it has a declaration just like the normal DTF 
 test scripts but just a few new tags that are used to define your setup. The
 tags themselves just define the important properties that are necessary for 
 the deployment feature to know where to setup each component. So you can see 
 that you need to specify at least the host and user  name to be used to SSH 
 into each machine, that will also be the user that the component would be 
 executed as. Then you can specify any properties directly in this file that 
 would be loaded into the component at runtime. 
 </p>
  
 <p>
 All of the deployment targets are available under the build directory 
 (dtf/build/dtf/dist) and all you need to do to see the available targets is 
 issue the command ./ant.sh -p to see each target and a description of what 
 it does. Now we'll go through the most used targets and how they can be used
 to setup and monitor your DTF configuration.
 </p>
  
 <h2>Setup Configuration</h2>
 <pre>./ant.sh setup-dtf -Ddeploy.config=path/to/your/config.xml</pre>
 
 <p>
 This will setup all of the machines identified in the deploy.config file 
 (default is config.xml) so that the DTFC and the machine issuing this 
 command can SSH into any of those other machines. This allows the DTFC to be
 able to startup the necessary components on the other machines and allows 
 the issuing machine to be able to gather logs.  The SSH keys generated and 
 used from now on will be under you $HOME/.dtf directory on *nix machines and
 under %HOMEPATH%/dtf directory for Windows. When executing this command be 
 sure to watch for prompts like so:
 </p>
  
 <pre>
  setup-dtf: 
      [java] INFO  10/11/2009 11:06:24 DeployUI        - rlgomes@dayspentlist.corp.yahoo.com:
 </pre>
  
 <p> 
 This is basically a prompt from SSH requesting you type your password and 
 currently the password will be visible to the person typing. So be careful 
 not to do this step when others are watching your screen. 
 </p>
  
 <h2>Start Configuration</h2>
 <pre>./ant.sh deploy-start -Ddeploy.config=path/to/your/config.xml</pre>
  
 <p>
 The previous target starts up your DTFC first and then make sure that its up
 and running, then it will start up each of the DTFA specified and lastly 
 start up a DTFX if one is defined. Once this has completed you should be 
 able to check the status of your with the follow target.
 </p>
  
 <h2>Check Status of Configuration</h2>
 <pre>./ant.sh deploy-status -Ddeploy.config=path/to/your/config.xml</pre>
 
 <p>
 This will output the current state of your configuration when compared with 
 the configuration file you've specified. It will identify DTFA's that are no
 longer running as well as the state of your runner's (DTFX) last test run. 
 Here's an example of running this command with the tests/setup/ut_config.xml
 configuration file on your localhost:
 </p>
  
 <pre>./ant.sh -Ddeploy.config=tests/setup/ut_config.xml -Dhost=localhost -Duser=rlgomes deploy-status
  
 Buildfile: build.xml
  
 init: 
     [echo] Creating log dir ./logs/10-11-2009.14.19.05
     [mkdir] Created dir: /home/rlgomes/workspace/dtf/build/dtf/dist/logs/10-11-2009.14.19.05
      
 deploy-init:
 
 deploy-status: 
     [java] INFO  10/11/2009 14:19:09 DeployDTF       - Status of dtfc on localhost
     [java] INFO  10/11/2009 14:19:09 DeployDTF       - DTFC on localhost
     [java] INFO  10/11/2009 14:19:09 DeployDTF       - DTFA [dtfa-0] on localhost is locked
     [java] INFO  10/11/2009 14:19:09 DeployDTF       - DTFA [dtfa-1] on localhost is locked
     [java] INFO  10/11/2009 14:19:09 DeployDTF       - DTFA [dtfa-2] on localhost is locked
     [java] INFO  10/11/2009 14:19:10 DeployDTF       - DTFX on localhost running tests/ut/state_management.xml:41,16
      
 BUILD SUCCESSFUL 
     Total time: 6 seconds 
 </pre>
  
 <p> 
 You can easily see the state of each of the components connected and that 
 your DTFX is currently on the test tests/ut/state_management.xml at line 41.
 You can also watch the output easily with the target deploy-watch. The 
 deploy-watch target will tail the output file on the DTFX and you can watch 
 it on your screen and Ctrl-C that whenever you'd like. Once the status 
 reports that the DTFX is completed you can easily gather your logs.
 </p>
  
 <h2>Saving your Logs</h2>
 <pre>./ant.sh -Ddeploy.config=tests/setup/config.xml deploy-savelogs</pre>
  
 <p>
 This target simply copies back all of the component output files to the 
 dtf_logs directory and will copy any other of the log files from the runner 
 that were specified with the attribute logs (comma separated list). Your old
 dtf_logs will be backed up to the dtf_logs_bk in case you required them for 
 some reason.
 </p>
 
 <h2>Waiting for a deployment to finish running tests</h2>
 <p>
 You can easily wait on an existing setup that has a DTFX running in it by 
 using the "deploy-wait" target to wait till the DTFX has completed and reports
 the exact status of that completion.
 </p>
 
 <h2>Other Targets</h2>
 <p>
 There are quite a few other deployment targets and you can easily check on 
 the available targets by issuing an "ant -p", like so:
 </p>
 <pre>
 > ant -p
 Buildfile: build.xml
 
 Main targets:
  deploy-savelogs  collect all of the logs for the DTF setup identifed by the ${deploy.config} property
  deploy-start     start the DTF setup defined in the ${deploy.config} file
  deploy-status    check the status of the DTF setup identified in the config file
  deploy-stop      This target will stop the specified DTF config and collect all of the logs
  deploy-wait      wait for the DTF setup defined in the ${deploy.config} file to complete running the test
  deploy-watch     sets up all machines identified in the ${deploy.config} file so they can be used by the other deploy-xxx targets
  run_dtfa         startup the DTFA component
  run_dtfc         startup the DTFC component
  run_dtfx         startup the DTFX component
  run_dvt          run DTF deployment verification tests (dvt).
  run_ut           run DTF unit tests.
  setup-script     execute a script on all machines identified in the ${deploy.config} file
  setup-ssh        sets up all machines identified in the ${deploy.config} file so that the deploy-xxx tags can SSH to those machines without any issues
 </pre>
 
 <h2>Host Requirements</h2>
 
 <p>
 The host machines that you are going to deploy to require an ssh server 
 running on them and they should have Java 1.5+ installed. Other than that
 there is a requirement at the OS level, that the following commands are 
 available:
