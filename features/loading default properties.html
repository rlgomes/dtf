 Because sometimes agent command lines can get pretty long including the 
 tunneling properties, agent specific attributes and other settings and 
 writing that out every time on the command line can be bothersome, there 
 is now a single property that can be used to load default properties into
 the current component about to be executed. This property name is 
 dtf.defaults and it will load a Java Properties file with key=value 
 lines. There is a default behavior of making all properties available to
 all the code within DTF but also any properties that do not start with 
 dtf.* prefix will be loaded as Agent attributes that can later be used to
 lock the components. In other words, if you have a property named 
 cli.type=xxx in your default properties file and load it using this 
 property you can then use the lockcomponent tag like so:

<div class="xmlverb-default">&lt;<span class="xmlverb-element-name">lockcomponent</span> <span class="xmlverb-attr-name">id</span>="<span class="xmlverb-attr-content">AGENT${agent}</span>"&gt;<span class="xmlverb-text"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&lt;<span class="xmlverb-element-name">attrib</span> <span class="xmlverb-attr-name">name</span>="<span class="xmlverb-attr-content">client.type</span>" <span class="xmlverb-attr-name">value</span>="<span class="xmlverb-attr-content">xxx</span>" /&gt;<span class="xmlverb-text"><br>
</span>&lt;/<span class="xmlverb-element-name">lockcomponent</span>&gt;</div>
</div>

 And you know you'd be locking the component who had that property and 
 not any other one. This is useful for the user of the framework to setup 
 agents with properties that define location, build and even APIs available 
 from that agent for executing tests.
