<div class='feature_description'><p>
 The json stream type generates a JSON document from the XSD location you 
 passed as an argument as well as the size you wanted as a target size. The 
 one thing to remember is that since we have to respect the grammar being 
 used we may have to use more or less bytes in order to conform to the grammar
 and be off of your desired size by a small percentage. 
 </p>
 <p>
 Using the json streaming property is as simple as referencing the property
 like so:
 </p>
 <pre>
 ${dtf.stream(json,storage://INPUT/list.xsd,128)}
 </pre>
 <p>
 The previous property will generate a JSON document that respects the 
 list.xsd referenced and will attempt to make it exactly 128 bytes in length.
