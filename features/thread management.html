 Thread management within DTF is important so that DTF can correctly release
 agents whenever a DTFX (runner) disconnects during a test run. For this we 
 have ThreadMgr class, which is able to register threads that can be
 interrupted if an agent is no longer being used and then there is an 
 underlying utlility that can be used to detect the interruption and stop 
 iterating.
 </p>
 <p>
 Remember that if you register a thread you should always unregister it when
 it has finished executing for good practice. Here is a small code example of
 how you should do such a thing in your own tag:
 </p>
 <pre>
 Thread t = new Thread() { 
      public void run() { 
          System.out.println("Do your thing!");
      } 
 };
 
 t.start();
 ThreadMgr.registerThread(t);
 try { 
      // do something else 
      t.join();
 } finally { 
      Threadmgr.unregisterThread(t);
 }
 </pre>
 <p>
 Very simple to use and it gaurantees that DTF can always clean up any of your
 threads even if your code does something bad or just fails to correctly clean
 up in certain instances. Any time that the Thread Manager has to clean up a 
 thread because the agent is being released but the Thread is still registered
 under the ThreadMgr it will log to the screen a message like so on the agent 
 side:
 </p>
 <pre>
 ThreadMgr       - Interrupted [Thread-27,Thread-28,Thread-29]
 </pre>
 <p>
 Naming your threads according to your activity would make those thread names
 more meaningful and allow you to better understand whree they were registered.
