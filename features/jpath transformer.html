 The jpath transformer is just like the xpath one where you can use XPath 
 expressions, but in this case you're applying them to JSON objects.
 </p>
                 
 <p>
 The JPath works very similarly to the XPath usage but the difference is the 
 data being operated on is a JSON object. The nice thing is the language 
 doesn't change at all so if we had a JSON object contained in a property 
 like so:
 </p>
                    
 <pre>
  <property name="json_array">
  { 
    "list": [
             { "id": "1001", "type": "Regular" },
             { "id": "1002", "type": "Chocolate" },
             { "id": "1003", "type": "Blueberry" },
             { "id": "1004", "type": "Devil's Food" }
            ]
  }
  </property> 
 </pre>
                   
 <p>
 Say we wanted to be able to get the 3rd element in the a list and just print 
 the value of the attribute type, here's how we could easily log that exact 
 part of the JSON object:
 </p>
                   
 <pre>
  <log>${json_array:jpath:/list[3]/@type}</log>
 </pre>
                   
 <p>
 Its pretty easy to see that the power of using XPath expressions against JSON
 objects allows you to do a lot more with your JSON data in your test than you
 could possibly imagine.
