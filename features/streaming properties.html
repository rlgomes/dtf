 This feature is extremely useful when you need to generate large amounts of
 data but you can't afford to have it all stored in memory at one time during
 execution because it would break your application. Referencing a streaming
 property is as easy as referencing any other property and can be done so, 
 like so:
 </p> 
 <pre>${dtf.stream([random|repeat|etc],[size],[additional arguments separated by commas])}</pre>
 <p>
 Internally these properties are not resolved into the data that they 
 represent but instead into an InputStream that can be read and immediately 
 sent to whatever OutputStream is awaiting data. To the test writer they're 
 used the same way any other property would be used but they allow the test
 writer to generate hundreds of streams sending GB objects at the same time
 while never hold more than a few MB (total) in memory. The main difference 
 when using these properties is in the way the property is handled within 
 the tag code where the developer can pick up an InputStream to read the data 
 in a way more efficient manner than being give a huge chunk of data in a 
 String.
 </p>

 The Streaming properties are broken down into the following 2 types:
 
 <h2>Unstructured Stream Properties</h2>
 <p>
 There are a few unstructured stream types types already built into DTF which
 allow you to generate random and repeated data patterns, these include:
 </p>
 <ul>
      <li><a href='../features/random stream type.html'>Random Stream Type</a></li>
      <li><a href='../features/repeat stream type.html'>Repeat Stream Type</a></li>
 </ul> 

 <h2>Structured Stream Properties</h2>
 <p>
 There are also structured data streaming types which generate data that are 
 structured documents such as XML or JSON. The currently available structured
 stream types are:
 </p>
 <ul>
      <li><a href='../features/xml stream type.html'>XML Stream Type</a></li>
 </ul>
 
 <h2>Using DTF Streams in your Code</h2>
 Now to take advantage of streaming properties as the developer of a tag you 
 need to use a slightly different method when retrieving property data. This
 means that instead of using <b>replaceProperties()</b> function you will have
 to use the <b>replacePropertiesAsInputStream()</b> which if the underlying
 property is a DTF streaming property it will return an InputStream that you 
 can use to get your data without having to house it all in memory.</div></body></html>
