<div class='feature_description'><p>
 The random stream type generates a random sequence of bytes of the size that
 you choose with the optional seed you specify. The actual random data 
 follows the details explained in the <a href='../features/generating random data.html'>Generating Random Data</a> 
 section. 
 </p>
 <p>
 Using the random streaming property is as simple as referencing the property
 like so:
 </p>
 <pre>
 ${dtf.stream(random,1024,1234)}
 </pre>
 <p>
 The previous property defines a random stream of data that has 1024 bytes in 
 length and has a random seed of 1234. This pseudo random data is generated
 following some rules as explained earlier in this document and can always
 be re-generated using the same seed. This means you only have to store the
 size & seed to be able to do data validation later on and not have to save 
 the data itself.
