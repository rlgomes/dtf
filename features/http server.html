 Within DTF it is possible to start your own HTTP server that will respond 
 to any type of HTTP method and be able to construct an HTTP response to your
 required needs. You'll find that you have to be a bit careful when starting
 and shutting down the httpserver because otherwise you may create a test that
 gets stuck waiting for a parallel executed http_server that doesn't end 
 because you haven't issued the shutdown correctly. A simple recipe to follow
 when using the http_server tag can be seen in the following lines:
 </p>
 
 <pre>&lt;parallel&gt;    
     &lt;http_server port="28080"&gt;
         &lt;http_listener method="PUT" path="/testpath"/&gt;
     &lt;/http_server&gt;
        
     &lt;try&gt;
         &lt;log&gt;Do something...&lt;/log&gt;
         &lt;finally&gt;
             &lt;http_server command="stop" port="28080"/&gt;
         &lt;/finally&gt;
     &lt;/try&gt;
 &lt;/parallel&gt;
</pre>
 
 <p>
 The previous template works well because after staring the HTTP server we're 
 very careful to protect the stop command within a try/finally statement
 that guarantees we'll always stop the server before proceeding from whatever 
 client activity we have tried to execute.
