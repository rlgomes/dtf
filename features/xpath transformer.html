 We've already seen that properties can be identified by using the following 
 syntax ${propertyname}. Now this is simple and straightforward but sometimes 
 the contents the property may contain more than just plain text and in those 
 cases we may want to only reference certain elements within the structured 
 data. For this we currently have the ability to apply transformations on the 
 property's data using various  data query languages. Currently we support 
 XPath on the any XML data within a property and here's a simple example of 
 how this works:
 </p>
 
 <p> 
 So lets say we have the property myxml that contains the following xml 
 snipplet:
 </p>
 <pre>&lt;list&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;3&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;4&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;5&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;6&lt;/item&gt;
  &lt;/list&gt;
</pre>
 
 <p>
 Now lets say we wanted to reference the myxml property but we only want the 
 forth value of the child item in the XML data. This is how we would achieve 
 that:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
 <log>${myxml:xpath://list/item[3]}</log>
 </pre>

 The Xpath language is a standard and all of the information on this standard 
 can be easily found by searching for XPath examples online.
