<div class='feature_description'><p>
 The repeat stream type generates a sequence of data that repeats the pattern
 you specified till it has generated the desired size.
 </p>
 <p>
 Using the repeat streaming property is as simple as referencing the property
 like so:
 </p>
 <pre>
 ${dtf.stream(repeat,1024,ABC)}
 </pre>
 <p>
 The previous property defines a repeat stream of data that has 1024 bytes in 
 length and will repeat the string ABC until the desired length has been 
 reached. The data generated can always be re-generated using  the same seed.
 This means you only have to store the size & seed to be able to do data 
 validation later on and not have to save the data itself.
