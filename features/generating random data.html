 This is the random generator used by DTF and it can be easily reproduced in 
 other languages so that the random generation of bytes can be similar and 
 data validation can be easily done without having to worry about the data
 generated in another language not matching the same pseudo random method that
 is within DTF.
 </p>
 <p>
 <b>NOTE: This implementation is NOT thread-safe. So make a new instance
          of DTFRandom for each of your threads.</b>
 </p>
 <p> 
 The following is based on information taken from 
 <a href="http://www.javamex.com/tutorials/random_numbers/xorshift.shtml">here</a>
 and re-implemented within DTF. Based on a solution that was found in 2003 by 
 George Marsaglia in the form of XORShift Random Number Generators. Marsaglia 
 showed that a generator involving three shifts and three XOR operations 
 generates a "full" period and that the resulting values satisfy various 
 statistical tests of randomness that even the LCGs fail (LCG algorithm is 
 currently used by Java).
 </p> 
 <p>
 The "magic" values of 21, 35 and 4 have been found to produce good results. 
 With these values, the generator has a full period of 2^64-1, and the 
 resulting values pass Marsaglia's "Diehard battery" of statistical tests for 
 randomness.

 Here is the way that random data is currently generated within DTF:

 Sample code of how we generate the pseudo random data within DTF, this file
 can be found at <b>src/java/com/dtf/yahoo/util/DTFRandom.java</b>.

 <pre>
 public void nextBytes(byte[] bytes) {
     for (int i = 0, len = bytes.length; i < len; ) {
         for (int rnd = nextInt(),
              n = Math.min(len - i, Integer.SIZE/Byte.SIZE);
              n-- > 0; rnd >>= Byte.SIZE) {
             // not allowing $ because then a property could be accidentally
             // created, and this would lead to unnecessary issues.
             byte b = (byte)rnd;
             if ( b == '$' ) continue;
             bytes[i++] = b;
         }
     }
 }
 
 public int nextInt() {
     return next(Integer.SIZE);
 }
 
 public boolean nextBoolean() {
     return next(1) != 0;
 }
   
 protected int next(int nbits) {
     long x = this.seed;
     x ^= (x << 21);
     // unsigned shift so we don't drag the signal
     x ^= (x >>> 35);
     x ^= (x << 4);
     x &= ((1L << nbits) - 1);
     return (int) x;
 }

 The following is an example of how to mimic the same random byte generator 
 that is currently implemented in DTF in C. This same method can be used in 
 C++. The source file containing this sample can be found in DTF at
 <b>src/native/random.c</b> and should have a few comments on how to build it 
 and run the sample test that exists.

 const int INTEGER_SIZE = 32;

     return (a < b ? a : b);
 }
 
 void nextBytes(char* bytes, int length) {
    int i,rnd,len,n;

    for (i = 0, len = length; i < len; ) {
         for (rnd = nextInt(),
              n = min(len - i, INTEGER_SIZE/BYTE_SIZE);
