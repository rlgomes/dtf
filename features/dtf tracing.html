                   The tracing feature built into DTF allows you to easily be
                   able to trace all of the actions that are executed at 
                   runtime as well as any property resolving that happens at
                   runtime will be printed. Turning this on is as easy as 
                   setting the property <b>dtf.tracing</b> to true and results 
                   in the appearance of the following type of log lines:
                   </p>
                   <pre>
                   Trace           - EXEC main If {} at tests/ut/if.xml:100:9
                   </pre>
                   <p> 
                   The above line shows that the tag If was being executed by
                   the thread "main" and that this action came from the line
                   100 from the test at tests/ut/if.xml. The {} brackets don't
                   contain any properties because the If tag doesn't have any
                   properties associated with it. 
                   </p>
                   <pre>
                   Trace           - PROP main If "${test1}" to "true"
                   </pre>
                   <p>
                   The above line shows a property being resolved in the 
                   string ${test1} and that the result is true. We currently
                   only show the values of the properties that are resolved 
                   because this way you can easily tell if a property was used
                   by a previous tag or not. 
                   </p>
                   <p> 
                   This feature can be extended to include other information 
                   in the near future but for the time being lets keep this 
                   simple enough that any new user to DTF can easily understand
                   what is going on in their test when things are not running
                   as expected.
