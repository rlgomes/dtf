 DTF has a very simple and powerful way of transforming your property data at 
 resolution time that allows you to extract/append/encode/escape your data so 
 that it can be used by another tag in a different way. The syntax for the 
 property transformation is the following:
 </p>
 
 <pre> 
 ${property_name:transformer:arguments for transformer}
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 All of the existing Transformers should have their DTF Documentation created
 and be under the "Transformers" documentation group so they can easily be 
 looked up.
