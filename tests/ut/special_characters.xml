        DTF test to demonstrate the usage of special characters within DTF. This
        test will go into showing how to pass whitespaces correctly to certain 
        tags as well as the reasons why normalization is applied to the attributes
        of XML tags.

    <!-- As is stated in the XML Spec at 
         http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#AVNormalize 
        
         "Before the value of an attribute is passed to the application or 
          checked for validity, the XML processor MUST normalize the attribute 
          value by applying the algorithm below ..."
          
         This means that if you want to pass certain characters such as a space
         inside the attribute value then you're going to have to encode it using
         the following special characters:
        
            white space characters:
            tab             -> &#09;
            line feed       -> &#10;
            carriage return -> &#13;
           
            special XML characters:
            <   -> &lt;
            >   -> &gt;
            '   -> &apos;
            "   -> &quot; 
    
        Because of the above if you really need to preserve the state of text 
        when being used within DTF then you shouldn't pass those values in the 
        XML attributes but instead pass them in the text node of the XML tag.        
         -->
   
    <!-- the broken tab will be replace with a single space by the XML parser
         as defined in the XML specification. --> 
    <property name="brokentab" value="	"/>
    <property name="tab" value="&#09;"/>
    <!-- this one works because its the child text node -->
    <property name="another.tab">	</property>
    <if>
        <neq op1="${tab}" op2="${another.tab}"/>
        <then>
            <fail message="Property tab and property another.tab should have had the same value :("/>
        </then>
    </if>
   
    <!-- an enter in the child text node --> 
    <property name="enter">
</property>
    <!-- enter encoded using XML special characters -->
    <property name="another.enter" value="&#10;"/>
    <if>
        <neq op1="${enter}" op2="${another.enter}"/>
        <then>
            <fail message="Property enter and property another.enter should have had the same value :("/>
