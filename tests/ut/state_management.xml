    With a 5MB property created at runtime we try to do a few executions on 
    another component seeing if we'll hit the OutOfMemoryException if the state 
    management code wasn't freeing up the resources of the many threads created 
    during these runs.
    
    This test is also one of the first tests to run in order to also produce 
    agents that could possibly have a lot of non freed up resources that would 
    almost certainly make the other tests fail.
