Current Test Directory Structure
--------------------------------

examples -> holds tests that are referenced in the documentation 

perf -> performance tests used to monitor the performance of various activities
        that can be performed within DTF and validate that there are no signficant
        regressions.
                   
ut -> unit tests designed to run anywhere DTF does and they should always be 
      executed before each check-in of any changes to DTF itself.
      
ut-dep -> they are unit tests as well but the tags being tested depend on a 
          Webdav server or Proxy Server and therefore can't run in a normal 
          setup. Working on making these easier to run as part of the normal 
          unit tests.
            
          What test requires what ?
          
          - apache setup with webdav for http_streaming.xml (instructions on 
            apache setup in the test itself)
            
          - proxy server somewhere (squid locally on linux would work fine) for
            http_proxy.xml
