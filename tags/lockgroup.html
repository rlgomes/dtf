               This tag offers the ability to specific a group for locking so
               that DTF can be smart and allow for the whole group to be 
               locked or release the partial group so that the resources
               can be used by others that would be locking components at the
               same time. This avoids deadlocks because two tests being
               executed in parallel would like to lock the same 3 resources
               and end up failing because they locked 1-2 components each and
               locked the other test out.

               <h2>When to use a lockgroup?</h2>
               <p>
               A lockgroup should be used whenever you are locking more than 1
               component and are going to be running this test concurrently 
               with other tests. The lockgroup gives DTF the ability to 
               correctly free up locks when they're not completely fulfilled
               for a testscript to execute and give those resources to another
               test that can execute while this testscript awaits its turn 
               to use the available resources.
