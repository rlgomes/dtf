Some important details about the external packages:

- Zookeeper was complied using Java 1.5 and therefore the jar in the lib 
  directory only differs from the distribution in the zookeeper-bin because of
  that. 
  
- the libraries msv,xsdlib and isorelax libraries are all used to do RNG validation
  using the normal Java builtin JAXP but by using the the isorelax-jaxp bridge
  supplied. (got the isorelax-jaxp-bridge from 
  http://weblogs.java.net/blog/kohsuke/archive/2006/02/validate_xml_us.html).
