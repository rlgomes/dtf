About version numbers:

    In the dtf package there is a single version number that refers to the cvs
    tagged version of dtf:
      
       * dtf-0.1.1
       
    The version 0.1.1 of DTF that can always be checked out again from CVS using
    the tag v0_1_1.
    
    For plugins (such as tribble) the plugin also has part of their name in the
    yinst package name, like so:
    
       * tribble_dtf-0.1.2_1880
       
    The first part before the _dtf is the name of the plugin then the version of
    DTF itself is the part before the next underscore so that would be 0.1.2.
    Lastly the plugin itself can have different versions, for now if you're on 
    SVN then its easiest to tag with the SVN revision number. If you happen to 
    be on CVS we'll have to do a tagging system similar to DTF itself.
