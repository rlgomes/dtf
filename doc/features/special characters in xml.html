 You can't write everything you would in a text file in an XML file. Sometimes 
 because certain characters such as <,> or – are used in the XML language 
 itself and other times because the XML specification 
 (http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/) has been very careful to normalize some strings 
 and not others. So lets cover some of the basics of using special characters 
 in XML and in the comments within an XML document.
 </p>
 <p>
 So firstly lets figure out how to have XML written inside of XML that isn't 
 interpreted by DTF. This is achieved quite easily using the CDATA encoding 
 like so:
 </p>
 
 </p><pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?&gt;
&lt;property name="xmldata"&gt;
      &lt;![CDATA[
          &lt;myxml&gt;
              &lt;list&gt;
                  &lt;element1/&gt;
                  &lt;element2/&gt;
                  &lt;element3/&gt;
              &lt;/list&gt;
          &lt;/myxml&gt;]]&gt;
  &lt;/property&gt;
</pre><p align='justify'>
  
 <p>
 Anything written between <![CDATA[ and ]]> is preserved exactly as is and can
 contain any characters you'd like. Another situation that sometimes comes up 
 is when you want to write special characters into the attribute value of a 
 given tag. Here is where the XML specification gives us some trouble, because
 they have defined that attribute values must be normalized. This 
 normalization basically converts tabs into a single space which can be quite 
 annoying and unexpected. In order to work around this you can do the 
 following:
 </p>
 
 </p><pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?&gt;
&lt;sequence&gt;
      &lt;property name="tab" value="&amp;#09;"/&gt;   
      &lt;property name="another.enter" value="&amp;#10;"/&gt;
  &lt;/sequence&gt;
</pre><p align='justify'>
 
 <p> 
 So you basically have to use the XML special characters when dealing with 
 attribute values. This means that if you wanted to have more complicated 
 data with different whitespace characters you should probably use an 
 underlying text node to your tag and not store this data in the XML attribute.
 </p>
 <p>
 The only thing really missing is special characters within comments and the 
 only characters that you can't use inside of an XML comment are the – 
 characters because they confuse most parsers when it comes to knowing where 
 the comment starts and ends. XML comments are contained between <-- and -->.
