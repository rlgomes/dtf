 Currently there is only an Apache Client HTTP implementation for the DTF 
 HTTP tags. This implementation uses the Java X.509 Certificate Management 
 layer for all certificates related with HTTPS requests. So in order to add 
 your own certificate to this chain you'll have to use Java specific tools for
 this effect. 
 
 The certification chain with Java has its keystore located at:
 <ul> 
     <li>Unix: ${user.home}/.java/deployment/security.</li>
     <li>Windows: ${deployment.user.home}\security</li>
 </ul>

 <p>
 Other locations, such as system level certificates and the ability to even 
 change the keystore location  is documented <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/deployment/deployment-guide/jcp.html">here</a>.
 To manage the certificates int these keystores you must use the keytool tool 
 supplied with the Java JDK and has some usage instructions <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/windows/keytool.html">here</a>.
 The usage of the tool is very straightforward if you already have an existing
 X.509 certificate you want to add to your keystore you just use the 
 following:
 </p>
 
 <pre>
 keytool -import -alias alias_for_your_ca -file newCA.cer
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 So on the agent systems where you'd like to issue HTTPS requests you'll have 
 to add this new certification authority to your chain, either at the user 
 level (keystore location mentioned above) or you can do it at the system 
 level for the machine by using the keytool to add this same certificate 
 authority to the chain that everyone using that JDK would trust in (be aware 
 this may not be the most secure way of doing things).
