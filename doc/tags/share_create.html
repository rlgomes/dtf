               in DTF. This resource works across components and can be used
               to share information between any thread running on any component
               in DTF. When creating a share remember that it is local to the
               component where you created it but its accessed over the 
               network for all the other components.

               Also remember that you can develop your own share point types
               if necessary and consult the developers guide for more 
               information.</p></dd><br/><br/><dt><b>Author </b></dt><dd>Rodney Gomes</dd><br/><br/><dt><b>Optional Attributes</b></dt><dd><br/><table border=1><tr valign='top'><td width='100px'><b>type</b></td><td><p align='justify'>The share point type is important becuase it defines how
                all your share_sets and share_gets will behave. The default
                is 'single', look at the following table for more 
                information on the various share types:
                
           <b>Share Types</b>
           <table border="1">
               <tr>
                   <th>Type</th> 
                   <th>Description</th> 
               </tr>
               <tr>
                   <td>single</td> 
                   <td>
                   The single share point type basically will hold a 
                   single instance of the last set done to this share.
                   Any previous share_set is lost and can never be 
                   retrieved. This type is usually used when you just want
                   to have share that contains the latest and greatest 
                   version of some information.
                   </td> 
               </tr>
               <tr>
                   <td>queue</td> 
                   <td>
                   The queue share point type basically will queue up all 
                   of the share_sets done and will return them in the same 
                   order back to the each of the share_gets that are done. 
                   If N threads are doing share_get on the same queue 
                   share point they will each get a different set from the 
                   queue and never will there be 2 threads have the same 
                   thing returned.
                   </td>
               </tr>
               <tr>
                   <td>cumulative</td> 
                   <td>
                   The cumulative share point is special because just like 
                   the queue it will keep all the sets that were done in a 
                   queue, but when a share_get comes through this share 
                   point will return all of its current information back 
                   to that one share_get.  So it acts like a buffer where 
                   you can write a bunch of different information and once 
                   one single share_get comes through it will be able to 
                   pick up all the information in a single request. You 
                   must be careful to not overload this type of share 
                   point with thousands of sets because you will break 
                   the agents with an out of memory exception.
